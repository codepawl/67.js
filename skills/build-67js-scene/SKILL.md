description: Build, light, film and refine 3D scenes through the 67js MCP server (npm package @codepawlhq/67js). Use when an agent has the scene_* tools and must model parts, set materials, lights, HDRI, color looks, fog, lens and depth of field, animate a camera, lights, sun, sky and effects, bake light, fix z-fighting or recover from a tool error.

# Build scenes with 67js over MCP

You drive 67js through the `scene_*` tools of the `67js-mcp` server. No checkout is needed.
Start the server with `npx --package @codepawlhq/67js 67js-mcp --backend gpu --assets <abs dir> --jobs <abs dir>`
(`--assets` for GLB, HDR and cube files, `--jobs` for render jobs, `--backend cpu` without a GPU).

## Loop

1. `scene_capabilities`: with no arguments it returns a short index of features, limits and topic names. Pass
   `topic` for the field list of one feature (`environment`, `materialFields`, `geometries`, `meshEdit.bevel`,
   `motion`). Tool schemas list only common fields, so read the topic before a feature you have not used.
2. `scene_create` with a `recipe`: `{ "format": "67js.scene", "schemaVersion": 1, "geometries": [], "materials": [], "nodes": [] }`
   plus optional `camera`, `environment`, `effects`, `shadow`, `motion`, `bake`, `timeline`.
3. `scene_inspect`: node IDs, bounds, `diagnostics`, current `revision`.
4. `scene_look`: the PNG. Add `labels: true` to match node names to the image. Judge the image, not the lint.
5. `scene_apply` with the current `expectedRevision` and a small `operations` batch. A stale revision fails whole.
6. `scene_checkpoint` before a risky batch, `scene_restore` to undo, `scene_release_checkpoint` after. Without a checkpoint, `scene_restore` with `revision` goes back to one of the last 4 earlier revisions.
7. `scene_export_recipe` keeps the result. `scene_dispose` before a different scene.

`sessionId` may be left out: one scene is active at a time.
Variants: `scene_apply` with a `branch` name, compare in one `scene_review` (a `branch` per shot), keep one with `scene_restore`.

## Pick the recipe

| Task | Read |
|---|---|
| Sky, HDRI, `.cube` look, tone mapping, fog, exposure, bloom, AO, outlines | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/look.md` |
| Sun, point, spot and area lights, caps, baked bounce light, flush faces | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/light.md` |
| Lens, focal length, depth of field, shift, orthographic | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/camera.md` |
| Motion tracks (camera, nodes, lights, sun, sky, effects), shots, timeline | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/film-and-animation.md` |
| A call failed, a diagnostic appeared, the picture is wrong | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/errors-and-recovery.md` |
| Polygon modeling: extrude, inset, bevel, booleans, mirror, array | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/mesh-modeling.md` |
| Scene code against the npm library, not MCP | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/scene-contract.md` |

## Defaults that save work

- Start from the default look: `environment.setup` `daylight`, AO off. `studio` suits products, `overcast` soft light,
  `sunset` warm low light. Do not hand-tune key, fill and ambient first.
- The preview draws a floor with a contact shadow under the lowest geometry. `environment.ground: false` removes it,
  so never add a floor node only for the shadow.
- Reuse one geometry ID for repeated parts and move them with node transforms.
- Put parts against each other with node `relations` (`attach`, `gap`, `flush`, `align`, `centered`) so one `set-node`
  resizes the body and the handle follows.
- Surfaces without UVs: material `pattern` (wood, bricks, marble, metal, fabric). Glass: `transmission` with a nonzero
  `thickness`. Details are in `scene_capabilities`.
- Hide a node with `visible: false`; `castShadow`, `receiveShadow`, `holdout` and `shadowCatcher` are node flags too
  (the last two need a transparent canvas, so they matter for exported composites, not `scene_look`).
- Characters and creatures: recipe `armatures` plus `skin` per mesh node, `motion.ik`, imported GLBs through the
  `asset` node field and `scene_asset_catalog`. Physics, cloth, particles and hair are recipe sections.
  `scene_inspect` reports their results; read those instead of guessing from a picture.
- A GLB for Blender: `scene_export_glb` (needs `--jobs`), it returns a path.

## Finish

Deliver the recipe, one `scene_look` image and any limit you hit. Say what you measured (counts, bounds, seconds)
apart from what you judged by eye. Do not claim Blender parity or general speed over three.js.
Changes, including unreleased and breaking ones: `https://67js.codepawl.com/changelog.json`.
A 67js bug: `gh issue create -R codepawl/67.js` with the steps, the recipe and a still; no local paths.
